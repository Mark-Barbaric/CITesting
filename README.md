# TDD Practice - Lesson 1

This code is designed to get you to practice TDD.

## Requirements

You are expected to use TDD to build out a class which is capable of doing the
relatively simple task of reversing a string and providing some member functions
which allow for convenient access to the object.

To see what is expected, take a look at main.cpp - you will notice that it
checks a few different things on the object. You need to implement these and
verify that they work by using TDD.

## Continuous Integration

Providing you work on this through GitHub classroom, your code will be built and
tested via our own Jenkins instance. Please note that this will not remain live
forever and will likely go away either after the conclusion or the module or
possibly the live lesson.

You can of course spin up your own Jenkins instance in order to try it yourself.
